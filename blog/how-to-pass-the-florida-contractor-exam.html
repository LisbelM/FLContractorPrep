          <p><strong>Passing the Florida General Contractor exam is about speed, organization, and smart practice — not memorization.</strong> The exam is open-book and time-pressured, so the candidates who win are the ones who can find answers quickly inside the approved references.</p>

          <h2>1. Understand the Exam Format Before You Study Anything</h2>
          <p>The Florida Certified General Contractor exam is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Open book</li>
            <li>Computer-based</li>
            <li>Multiple sections, typically including Business &amp; Finance, Contract Administration, and Project Management / Trade Knowledge</li>
            <li>Time-pressured, not knowledge-pressured</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>The biggest mistake candidates make is studying like it is a closed-book test.</strong> It is not. Speed and navigation matter more than memorization.</p>

          <h2>2. Master Your Reference Books (This Is the Real Exam)</h2>
          <p>The exam is designed so that almost every question can be answered directly from the approved reference books. That means you are not expected to memorize code sections — you are expected to know:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which book contains the answer</li>
            <li>Where in the book it lives</li>
            <li>How the book is organized (chapters, indexes, tables)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>High-impact tactics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Tab every reference book aggressively</li>
            <li>Tab by chapter and by formulas, tables, definitions, and common topics</li>
            <li>Use consistent, readable labels</li>
            <li>Practice finding answers fast — if it takes more than 60 seconds, you are too slow</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Speed wins this exam. Our platform reinforces this by showing which references slowed you down most so you can re-tab and rehearse them.</p>

          <h2>3. Business &amp; Finance Is the Gatekeeper Section</h2>
          <p>This section causes more failures than any other because it is less construction common sense and more math, accounting, and legal logic.</p>
          <p>Focus hard on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Job costing and overhead</li>
            <li>Break-even analysis</li>
            <li>Net vs gross profit</li>
            <li>Retainage</li>
            <li>Bonds and insurance types</li>
            <li>Liens and payment laws</li>
            <li>Workers’ comp rules</li>
            <li>Contract law basics</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You do not need to be a CPA. You need to recognize the right formula and execute it fast. Build a one-page formula sheet and drill it until it is automatic.</p>

          <h2>4. Learn How Florida Asks Questions (They Are Tricky on Purpose)</h2>
          <p>Florida questions are designed to test judgment, not trivia. Expect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“BEST answer” wording</li>
            <li>Multiple answers that feel correct</li>
            <li>Scenario-based questions instead of direct facts</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How to attack questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Read the last sentence first to identify what they are really asking</li>
            <li>Identify the topic (safety, contract, payment, scheduling, code)</li>
            <li>Eliminate obviously wrong answers</li>
            <li>Verify with the reference even if you feel confident</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our question bank is built around Florida-style phrasing so you get used to how they test, not just what they test.</p>

          <h2>5. Do Not Read the Books — Learn to Navigate Them</h2>
          <p>Reading every approved reference cover-to-cover is a waste of time. Instead:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Skim each book once to understand structure and index quality</li>
            <li>Practice answering questions inside the book, not from memory</li>
            <li>Track which books slow you down and re-tab those sections</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A candidate who can find the answer quickly will beat someone who “knows” the material but cannot locate it under time pressure.</p>

          <h2>6. Practice Exams Are Non-Negotiable</h2>
          <p>You should not sit for the exam without multiple full-length practice exams. Practice tests:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teach timing</li>
            <li>Reveal weak areas</li>
            <li>Train your brain for Florida-style questions</li>
            <li>Improve reference lookup speed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Aim to finish practice exams with 20–30 minutes to spare. Review every missed question and note which reference slowed you down.</p>
          <p>Our timed simulations mirror the real exam format and give you performance breakdowns by topic.</p>

          <h2>7. Manage Time Like a Contractor, Not a Student</h2>
          <p>You are allowed to skip questions. Use a three-pass strategy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First pass: answer everything you can confidently</li>
            <li>Second pass: tackle medium-difficulty questions</li>
            <li>Last pass: time-intensive reference searches</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Never get stuck early. One question is never worth five minutes.</p>

          <h2>8. Watch for Florida-Specific Topics</h2>
          <p>Florida loves testing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lien laws and Notice to Owner rules</li>
            <li>Contractor responsibilities vs subcontractors</li>
            <li>Permitting obligations</li>
            <li>Safety standards</li>
            <li>Business structure liabilities</li>
            <li>Payment timelines</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If it sounds like something that could end up in court, Florida will test it.</p>

          <h2>How ContractorPrep Helps You Pass Faster</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Short, modular lessons</strong> so you can study in focused bursts</li>
            <li><strong>Large, Florida-specific question bank</strong> to build confidence fast</li>
            <li><strong>Realistic, timed simulations</strong> that mirror the exam format</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>Official resources</h2>
          <p>Use these official sources for the most current exam outlines, applications, and rules:</p>
